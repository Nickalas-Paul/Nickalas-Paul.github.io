        <h2>Where to Begin</h2>
        <p>Life transitions don't always announce themselves clearly. Sometimes they arrive as restlessness, exhaustion, or a sense that something true is being avoided.</p>
        
        <p>Often what you need most is not someone to tell you what to do, but space and attention to hear what you already know. A place to slow down without judgment or pressure to decide quickly.</p>

    <section id="work" class="section alt">

        <h2>The Work</h2>
        <p>This work is built around three interconnected dimensions of returning to yourself: knowing what is true for you, hearing your own voice beneath the noise, and seeing your situation with clarity and compassion. These are not steps to complete, but capacities to strengthen.</p>
        
        <h3>Know</h3>
        <p>Self-recognition matters more than information. This is about reconnecting with your own internal truth: the patterns, sensations, and knowing that live in your body and your intuition, beneath the noise of roles, expectations, and external narratives.</p>
        
        <p>It begins with slowing down enough to notice. To remember what you already sense to be true but may have learned to override. To distinguish between what you genuinely know and what you have been told to believe. This is not about gaining new knowledge. It's about returning to what is already present in your lived experience.</p>
        
        <h3>Hear</h3>
        <p>Many people live inside other people's voices: their families' hopes, their culture's shoulds, their fear's warnings, the world's urgency. Learning to hear yourself means distinguishing between your own internal signal and external pressure. It means noticing when fear or conditioning is steering instead of your own clarity.</p>
        
        <p>This is listening without judgment. Listening to your intuition, your body, your doubts, and your quiet knowing. It's learning to trust your own feedback about what feels true, what aligns, and what does not, even when that contradicts what others believe you should want or do.</p>
        
        <h3>See</h3>
        <p>With some grounding in your own knowing and voice comes the possibility of seeing more clearly. This is about discerning patterns, options, blind spots, and next steps with honest awareness rather than idealized fantasy. It is practical clarity, not vision boarding.</p>
        
        <p>Seeing includes seeing yourself with compassion, recognizing how you arrived at this threshold, what has shaped your choices, and where you may be caught without blame. From that grounded perspective, the actual landscape of what is possible becomes visible, and you can move forward without forcing or pretending.</p>
        
        <h3>How we work together</h3>
        <p>We meet in conversation. The pace is intentional. We follow what is most alive in you rather than what feels urgent or performative. I pay attention to where you are overriding your own clarity, where fear or expectation is steering, and where something important is asking to be acknowledged. I offer presence, attention, and questions that help you hear yourself more clearly.</p>
        
        <p>The lens we use is guided by what already resonates for you. Some people think and speak in psychological terms, others in symbolic or spiritual language, others in plain, everyday words. Astrology, religion, mythology, personal meaning-making, or no framework at all can be part of the conversation if that is how you naturally understand your experience.</p>

        <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
        <p>This practice is reflective and non-directive. I do not make decisions for you, predict outcomes, or take responsibility for your choices.</p>
        
        <p>This work is most appropriate when you are stable enough to reflect, able to remain responsible for your actions, and willing to engage honestly with yourself.</p>
        
        <p>If it becomes clear that another form of support would be more appropriate, I will name that directly.</p>

      <div class="container narrow">
        <h2>About and Contact</h2>
        <p>I do this work because I've crossed enough thresholds in my own life to know how disorienting they can be, and how little "fixing" most people actually need.</p>
        <p>The answer tends to be simpler than expected. The hardest task is hearing yourself from inside all of the noise and external pressure.</p>
        <p>I'm interested in helping people return to themselves without urgency, performance, or borrowed authority.</p>

          <h3>Contact</h3>
          <p>If this feels aligned, reach out with your details and a few lines about what you're navigating and what you're looking for. I'll respond honestly about fit and next steps.</p>
