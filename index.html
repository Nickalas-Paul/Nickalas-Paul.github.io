        <h2>Where to Begin</h2>
        <p>Life transitions don't always announce themselves clearly. Sometimes they arrive as restlessness, exhaustion, or a sense that something true is being avoided.</p>
        
        <p>Often what you need most is not someone to tell you what to do, but space and attention to hear what you already know. A place to slow down without judgment or pressure to decide quickly.</p>

      <div class="container narrow">
        <h2>The Work</h2>
        <p>This work is built around reflective inquiry. We focus less on solving problems and more on understanding what you already sense to be true, but may not yet trust or know how to act on.</p>
        
        <h3>Curiosity and self-inquiry</h3>
        <p>What makes this practice possible is your capacity to be sincere with your questions, stay with what emerges, and notice honestly what resonates and what does not. You don't need clarity before we begin, but you do need a genuine interest in understanding yourself rather than being directed.</p>
        
        <p>Curiosity is not a personality trait here. It's the posture that allows the work to unfold.</p>
        
        <h3>How we work</h3>
        <p>We meet in conversation. The pace is intentional. We follow what is most alive rather than what feels urgent or performative.</p>
        
        <p>I pay attention to where you are overriding your own clarity, where fear or expectation is steering, and where something important is asking to be acknowledged. I offer presence, attention, and questions that help you hear yourself more clearly.</p>
        
        <h3>What tends to be explored</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Life transitions and identity shifts</li>
          <li>Decisions that feel inevitable but difficult to face</li>
          <li>Burnout, misalignment, or loss of meaning</li>
          <li>The gap between what you know and what you live</li>
          <li>Learning to move without forcing or bypassing</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Framework and language</h3>
        <p>The work is not limited to any single way of understanding experience. This work is different from what is commonly understood as life coaching. The emphasis here is not on goals, performance, or improvement, but on orientation. We focus on supporting your relationship with your own life rather than optimizing it according to external measures.</p>
        
        <p>The lens we use is guided by what already resonates for you. Some people think and speak in psychological terms, others in symbolic or spiritual language, others in plain, everyday words. Astrology, religion, mythology, personal meaning-making, or no framework at all can be part of the conversation if that is how you naturally understand your experience.</p>

        <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
        <p>This practice is reflective and non-directive. I do not make decisions for you, predict outcomes, or take responsibility for your choices.</p>
        
        <p>This work is most appropriate when you are stable enough to reflect, able to remain responsible for your actions, and willing to engage honestly with yourself.</p>
        
        <p>If it becomes clear that another form of support would be more appropriate, I will name that directly.</p>

        <h2>About and Contact</h2>
        <p>I do this work because I've crossed enough thresholds in my own life to know how disorienting they can be, and how little "fixing" most people actually need.</p>
        <p>The answer tends to be simpler than expected. The hardest task is hearing yourself from inside all of the noise and external pressure.</p>
        <p>I'm interested in helping people return to themselves without urgency, performance, or borrowed authority.</p>

          <h3>Contact</h3>
          <p>If this feels aligned, reach out with your details and a few lines about what you're navigating and what you're looking for. I'll respond honestly about fit and next steps.</p>
