        <h2>Where to Begin</h2>
        <p>Life transitions don’t always announce themselves clearly. Sometimes they arrive as restlessness, exhaustion, or a sense that something true is being avoided.

This practice offers a calm, contained space to slow down, clarify what is real, and strengthen your relationship with your own knowing, especially during periods of change.

This is not therapy, crisis support, or outcome-guaranteed coaching.</p>

        <h2>The Work</h2>
        <p>This work is built around reflective inquiry. We focus less on solving problems and more on understanding what you already sense to be true, but may not yet trust or know how to act on.</p>
        
        <p>I don't offer prescriptions, interpretations, or answers about your life. I offer presence, attention, and questions that help you hear yourself more clearly.</p>
        
        <h3>How we work</h3>
        <p>We meet in conversation. The pace is intentional. We follow what is most alive rather than what feels urgent or performative.</p>
        
        <p>I pay attention to where you are overriding your own clarity, where fear or expectation is steering, and where something important is asking to be acknowledged.</p>
        
        <h3>What tends to be explored</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Life transitions and identity shifts</li>
          <li>Decisions that feel inevitable but difficult to face</li>
          <li>Burnout, misalignment, or loss of meaning</li>
          <li>The gap between what you know and what you live</li>
          <li>Learning to move without forcing or bypassing</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>No particular framework is required. We work in whatever language feels most natural to you.</p>

        <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
        <p>This practice is reflective and non-directive.</p>
        
        <p>It is not therapy, trauma treatment, crisis care, or a substitute for professional mental health support. I do not diagnose, treat, or manage psychological conditions.</p>
        
        <p>I do not make decisions for you, predict outcomes, or take responsibility for your choices.</p>
        
        <p>This work is most appropriate when you are stable enough to reflect, able to remain responsible for your actions, and willing to engage honestly with yourself.</p>
        
        <p>If it becomes clear that another form of support would be more appropriate, I will name that directly.</p>

        <h2>About and Contact</h2>
        <p>I'm Nickalas Bilotta. I do this work because I've crossed enough thresholds in my own life to know how disorienting they can be, and how little most people actually need fixing.</p>
        
        <p>I'm interested in helping people return to themselves without urgency, performance, or borrowed authority.</p>

        <div class="contact-box">
          <h3>Contact</h3>
          <p>Email is the simplest entry point.</p>
          
          <p>If this feels aligned, you can reach out with a few lines about what you're navigating and what you're looking for. I'll respond honestly about fit and next steps.</p>
